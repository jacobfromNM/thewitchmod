She was once a healer - eventually cast out by the village she once thought home. Now, she watches - an antiquated being - isolated in the shadows, whispering a siren's song, drawn to those who linger for too long in her spaces. You may not see her at firstâ€¦ you may hear her. If you catch her gaze, it may be too late.

### **Features:**

*   She spawns near players intermittently, bringing a thunderstorm in most cases (70% chance) - not a persistent/lingering presence.
*   Plays an ambient sound when she is close.
*   Destructive: she will destroy all light sources in the set range if triggered.
*   Eye contact makes her aggressive.
*   Invincible, but despawns immediately when hit.

Configuration file lets you adjust:

*   Spawn frequency
*   Stare duration threshhold
*   Light break radius
*   Pursuit speed when triggered
*   Proximity/Attack sound toggles
